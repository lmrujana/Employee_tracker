# Employee Tracker

## Description
This Command Line allows users to inspect and modify a company's employees data base. This app uses Node.js, inquirer.js, console.table and mysql modules, which need to be installed before running the app.

Inside db/ you can find the schema.sql file which creates the structure for the data base, as well as seed.sql which populates the db.
